<P><STRONG>Frodo</STRONG> is a free and portable Commodore 64 emulator, and
the world's first C64 emulator not bearing a “64” in its name.
<SAMP>:-)</SAMP>

<P>Frodo comes in two <A HREF="flavours.html">flavours</A>: The regular
<STRONG>Frodo</STRONG> which uses a cycle-exact emulation, and the
simplified <STRONG>Frodo Lite</STRONG> which is less compatible but runs
better on slower machines.

<P>Frodo emulates the hardware of an original, breadbin-style, PAL region
C64. In addition to a precise 6510/VIC emulation, Frodo features a full,
processor-level 1541 floppy drive emulation that is able to handle most fast
loaders. There is also an alternative, faster 1541 emulation of four drives
in .d64/.x64 disk images, .t64/LYNX archives, or directories of the host
file system. Finally, Frodo can emulate a “Datasette” tape drive using .tap
tape image files.

<P>Frodo runs on a variety of systems. The “core” distribution of Frodo
available from <A HREF="https://github.com/cebix/frodo4">GitHub</A> and the
<A HREF="https://frodo.cebix.net">Frodo homepage</A> is targeted at
platforms supported by the SDL2 framework.

<P>Ports of older versions of Frodo to other platforms, including classic
Mac OS, mobile devices, and game consoles, are maintained by independent
developer groups. Most of these are linked to from the <A
HREF="https://frodo.cebix.net">Frodo homepage</A>.
