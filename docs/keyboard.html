<H1>Keyboard Layout</H1>

<HR>

<P>The keyboard layout in Frodo closely resembles that of a real C64. The
individual rows of the keyboard are mapped as follows:

<PRE>
← 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 + -
   Q W E R T Y U I O P @ * ↑
    A S D F G H J K L : ;
     Z X C V B N M , . /
</PRE>

<P>In addition, Frodo uses the following keys to represent special keys on
the C64 keyboard, or to control functions of the emulator:

<PRE>
 Esc          - RUN/STOP
 Tab          - CTRL
 Backspace    - INS/DEL
 Delete       - INS/DEL
 Insert       - SHIFT + INS/DEL
 Return/Enter - RETURN
 Shift keys   - SHIFT
 Alt Keys     - C=
 Ctrl Keys    - CTRL
 Caps lock    - SHIFT LOCK
 Arrow keys   - CRSR ↑/↓ and CRSR ←/→
 F1-F8        - F1-F8
 F10          - Open <A HREF="settings.html">settings window</A>
 F11          - RESTORE
 F12          - Reset C64 and 1541
 Home         - CLR/HOME
 End          - &pound;
 Page Up      - ↑
 Page Down    - =
 Keypad Enter - Toggle fullscreen mode
 Keypad Plus  - Fast-forward
 Keypad Minus - Rewind
</PRE>

<P>This means that the famous key combination RUN/STOP-RESTORE must be typed
as Esc-F11. But you don't have to beat the F11 key as violently as the
RESTORE key on the original C64. <TT>:-)</TT><P>

<P>The arrow (cursor) keys work as expected. That is, the '↑' key
corresponds to “SHIFT + CRSR ↑/↓” on the C64. The same applies to the
function keys F2, F4, F6 and F8.

<P>The numerical keypad emulates a joystick in port 1 or 2, depending on the
state of the Num Lock (Num Lock off: port 2, Num Lock on: port 1):

<PRE>
   7    8    9
    ↖   ↑   ↗

   4    5    6
    ←  Fire →

    ↙   ↓   ↘
