<H1>Frodo and Frodo Lite</H1>

<HR>

<P>Frodo comes in two &ldquo;flavours&rdquo; that allow you to decide between speed and
accuracy of the emulation.

<H2>The single-cycle emulation &ldquo;Frodo&rdquo;</H2>

<P><B>Frodo</B> works with a cycle-based emulation model. That means that
the emulator switches between 6510 and VIC in every emulated Ã¸2 clock phase.
By doing this, Frodo achieves a very high precision (nearly all graphical
effects can be emulated), but at the expense of speed.

<H2>The line-based emulation &ldquo;Frodo Lite&rdquo;</H2>

<P><B>Frodo Lite</B> is a simplified version of Frodo that is line-based,
meaning that the activities that happen in parallel during one video line in
the real C64 are emulated one after the other for the different chips. This
offers an increase in speed at a still reasonable degree of precision of the
emulation. There are some things that cannot be emulated with this
technique, but it works fine with about 80% of all C64 programs and it is
also the faster of the two Frodo versions.

<P>In the settings window, Frodo Lite offers some advanced options which
allow control over certain timing aspects of the emulation.
