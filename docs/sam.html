<CITE>
“Frodo! Mr. Frodo, my dear!” cried Sam,<BR>
tears almost blinding him. “It's Sam, I've come!”
</CITE>

<HR>

<P>Frodo has a built-in machine language monitor that can be activated from
the “Tools” menu of the <A HREF="settings.html">settings window</A>: SAM
(<EM>Simple Assembler and Monitor</EM>). It provides full access to the
memory and hardware of the emulated C64 and 1541.

<P>SAM is controlled via a command-line interface, and all numbers are
represented in hexadecimal. With the command 'h' you can display a list of
all commands.

<P>SAM has two modes of operation, indicated by the prompt “C64>” or
“1541>”. You can switch between them with the “64” and “1541” commands. In
“C64” mode, all commands that access memory or the CPU operate on the
memory/CPU of the emulated C64. In “1541” mode, they operate on the emulated
1541 (this is only useful if the processor-level 1541 emulation is turned
on).

<P>All commands that access the C64 memory use the memory configuration set
with the 'k' command. On starting up SAM, the configuration is set to the
one the processor is in. Accesses from within SAM have the same effect as
accesses of the emulated processor. This affects especially the I/O
registers: a memory dump of $dc00-$de00 clears pending CIA interrupts as SAM
reads from $dc0d and $dd0d. With the 'v' commands, you can examine the state
of the I/O chips without modifying the state of the emulation.

<P>In all places where SAM expects a number, except in the assembler, you
can also enter an expression of hex numbers containing the arithmetic
operators '+', '-', '*', '/' and parentheses.

<P>Here is a description of all commands ('[]' marks a parameter than can be
left out, '{}' marks a parameter that can be repeated many times. If a
[start] parameter is left out, SAM continues at the address where the last
command stopped):


<PRE>
 a [start]           Assemble
</PRE>

<P>starts the assembler at the address “start”. SAM always prints the
address where the next instruction will be written to. The syntax of the
instructions conforms to the standard except for shift/rotate instructions
in the “accumulator” addressing mode. Those have to be entered without
operand, e.g. “lsr” instead of “lsr a”. Entering a blank line quits the
assembler and returns to the command mode of SAM.


<PRE>
 b [start] [end]     Binary dump
</PRE>

<P>displays the memory from “start” to “end” in byte-wise binary
representation. With this command, you can view character sets.


<PRE>
 c start end dest    Compare memory
</PRE>

<P>compares the memory in the range from “start” to (and including) “end”
with the memory at “dest”. The addresses of all different bytes and the
total number of differences (in decimal) are printed.


<PRE>
 d [start] [end]     Disassemble
</PRE>

<P>disassembles the memory from “start” to “end”. Undocumented opcodes are
marked with a star '*'.


<PRE>
 e                   Show interrupt vectors
</PRE>

<P>shows the currently active interrupt vectors of the 6510 (C64) or 6502
(1541) and (in C64 mode, if the Kernal ROM is mapped in) of the Kernal.


<PRE>
 f start end byte    Fill memory
</PRE>

<P>fills the memory in the range from “start” to (and including) “end” with
the value “byte”.


<PRE>
 i [start] [end]     ASCII/PETSCII dump
</PRE>

<P>shows the memory from “start” to “end” as ASCII/PETSCII characters.


<PRE>
 k [config]          Show/set C64 memory configuration
</PRE>

<P>'k' without parameters shows the memory configuration that is set for
SAM, 'k' with a parameter modifies it. On exiting SAM, the configuration set
by the 6510 processor port is reactivated. The memory configuration has no
effect in 1541 mode. The 8 possible configurations are:

<PRE>
  #  $a000-$bfff  $d000-$dfff  $e000-$ffff

  7   Basic ROM       I/O      Kernal ROM

</PRE>


<PRE>
 l start "file"      Load data
</PRE>

<P>loads the contents of the specified file into memory starting from
address “start”. The file name must be enclosed in quotation marks even if
it contains no spaces. This command cannot be used to load C64 programs as
it doesn't respect the embedded load address in the program.


<PRE>
 m [start] [end]     Memory dump
</PRE>

<P>displays the memory from “start” to “end” as hexadecimal numbers and
ASCII/PETSCII characters.


<PRE>
 n [start] [end]     Screen code dump
</PRE>

<P>displays the memory from “start” to “end” as characters, interpreting
each byte as a screen code of the standard C64 character set.


<PRE>
 o ["file"]          Copy output
</PRE>

<P>When a file name is specified, all following output is written to this
file. The file name must be enclosed in quotation marks even if it contains
no spaces. Entering 'o' without parameters closes the file and directs the
output into the window of SAM again.


<PRE>
 p [start] [end]     Sprite dump
</PRE>

<P>displays the memory from “start” to “end” in binary representation with
three bytes per line. With this command, you can view sprite data.


<PRE>
 r [reg value]       Show/set CPU registers
</PRE>

<P>'r' without parameters shows all 6510 (C64) or 6502 (1541) registers and
flags, and the instruction at the address specified by the program counter.
For the 6510, “DR” and “PR” are the data direction register and data
register of the processor port. To modify a register, give its name (“reg”)
and the new value (“value”) as parameters.


<PRE>
 s start end "file"  Save data
</PRE>

<P>writes the memory from “start” to (and including) “end” to the specified
file. The file name must be enclosed in quotation marks even if it contains
no spaces. This command cannot be used to save C64 programs as it doesn't
save a load address in the file.


<PRE>
 t start end dest    Transfer memory
</PRE>

<P>transfers the memory from “start” to (and including) “end” to “dest”.
Source and destination may overlap.


<PRE>
 vc1                 View CIA 1 state
</PRE>

<P>shows the state of CIA 1 ($dc00).


<PRE>
 vc2                 View CIA 2 state
</PRE>

<P>shows the state of CIA 2 ($dd00).


<PRE>
 vf                  View floppy state
</PRE>

<P>shows the state of the processor-level 1541 emulation.


<PRE>
 vs                  View SID state
</PRE>

<P>shows the state of the SID.


<PRE>
 vv                  View VIC state
</PRE>

<P>shows the state of the VIC.


<PRE>
 : addr {byte}       Modify memory
</PRE>

<P>writes the space-separated values “byte” into memory starting at “addr”.


<PRE>
 1541                Switch to 1541 mode
</PRE>

<P>switches to 1541 mode. All commands that access memory or the CPU will
operate on the emulated 1541 (processor-level) from then on.


<PRE>
 64                  Switch to C64 mode
</PRE>

<P>switches to C64 mode. All commands that access memory or the CPU will
operate on the emulated C64 from then on.


<PRE>
 ? expression        Calculate expression
</PRE>

<P>calculates the value of the given expression and displays it in decimal
and hexadecimal notation.
