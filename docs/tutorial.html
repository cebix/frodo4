Frodo accepts a single argument when started from the shell: The name of a
preferences file to load instead of the default "~/.local/share/cebix/Frodo/config".<P>

At first, a window for the emulation <A HREF="settings.html">settings</A>
appears. The actual emulation is started by a click on "Start". Then the
<A HREF="emulwindow.html">emulation</A> window appears in which the C64
startup message is displayed.<P>

To quit Frodo, either close the emulation window, or press F10 to bring up
the settings window and select "Quit".

Frodo may be started from the shell or from the Tracker. When started from
the shell, Frodo accepts a single argument: The name of a preferences file
to load instead of the default "Frodo Prefs".<P>

At first, the window for the emulation <A HREF="settings.html">settings</A>
appears. The actual emulation is started by a click on "Start". Then the <A
HREF="emulwindow.html">emulation</A> window appears in which the C64
startup message is displayed.<P>

You can quit from the running emulation by selecting the "Quit" menu
item.<P>

Frodo should be run in a 256-color workspace for maximum speed.<P>

Sampled sounds are only played correctly if "Limit Speed" is on and "Draw
every n-th frame" is set to "1" and if the emulation can sustain 100%
speed.<P>
