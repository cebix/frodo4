<H1>Emulation Window</H1>

<HR>

<P>The emulation window displays the C64 graphics and receives the keyboard
input.

<P>If the “Show Speed and Drive LED Status” <A
HREF="settings.html">setting</A> is enabled, Frodo uses the lower border of
the C64 display to overlay some information about the emulation speed
(unless it is running at 100%) and a representation of the activity/error
LEDs of the emulated disk drives.

<P>You can drag and drop .d64 disk image files or Frodo snapshot files into
the emulation window to mount the disk image in drive 8 or restore the
snapshot state, respectively.
