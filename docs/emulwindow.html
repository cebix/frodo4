<H1>Emulation Window</H1>

<HR>

<P>The emulation window displays the C64 graphics and receives the keyboard
input.

<P>If the “Show Speed and Drive LED Status” <A
HREF="settings.html">setting</A> is enabled, Frodo uses the lower border of
the C64 display to overlay some information about the emulation speed
(unless it is running at 100%) and a representation of the activity and
error status of the emulated disk and tape drives.

<P>You can drag and drop .d64/.g64 disk image files, .tap tape image files,
or Frodo snapshot files onto the emulation window to mount the image in
drive 8 or 1, or restore the snapshot state, respectively. You can also drop
folders to mount them in drive 8 in directory mode.

<P>Dropping a .crt cartridge image file onto the window “inserts” the
cartridge and also resets the C64 to allow the cartridge software to start.
Finally, you can drop C64 BASIC program files to directly load them into the
memory of the C64 (enter “RUN” to start a program after loading).
