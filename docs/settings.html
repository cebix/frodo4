<H1>Settings</H1>

<HR>

<P>The settings window appears directly after starting Frodo, or by pressing
<B>F10</B> while the emulation is running.


<H2>Drives</H2>

<P>The box <B>“Drive Paths”</B> has four fields, each corresponding to one
of four emulated Commodore 1541 floppy disk drives with the drive numbers 8,
9, 10 and 11 (normally you only need drive 8). For every drive, there is a
<EM>file selection button</EM> and a <EM>“Next Disk” button</EM>.

<P>Frodo offers three different modes for drive emulation (see <A
HREF="files.html">here</A> for details):

<UL>
<LI><EM>Disk Image Mode</EM> uses a binary dump of a 1541 floppy disk in the
.d64 or .x64 disk image format for providing true, sector-by-sector floppy
emulation. This is the preferred mode with the highest compatibility.
<LI><EM>Tape/Archive Mode</EM> makes the contents of a .t64 tape image file,
a LYNX archive file, or a single .p00 program file available to the emulated
C64 as a “pseudo disk”. Note that Frodo does not actually emulate a tape
drive; the contents of tape images are accessed as if they were a floppy
disk.
<LI><EM>Directory Mode</EM> makes the contents of a directory of the host
file system available to the emulated C64 as a “pseudo disk”.
</UL>

<P>The <B>file selection button</B> opens a dialog where you can choose a
.d64/.x64/.t64/LYNX file to mount in the corresponding drive on the emulator.
To select a directory for Directory Mode, choose any file within the
directory that is not of one of those image file types.

<P>The <B>“Next Disk” button</B> only works in Disk Image Mode and changes
the mounted .d64 or .x64 disk image file to the next one in a series. Frodo
tries to be a bit clever about figuring out what that “next disk” actually
is. If the image files have names ending with patterns like “Disk 1”/“Disk
2”, “Side A”/“Side B”, “(1)”/“(2)”, etc. it is usually successful.

<P>If <B>“Enable Full 1541 Emulation”</B> is turned on, the four emulated
1541s are disabled and replaced by a single 1541 emulation (drive 8) that
only operates on .d64/.x64 files, but emulates the entire 1541 hardware and
is compatible with most fast loaders and some forms of copy protection, at
the expense of considerably slower disk access. If you have a .d64 with a
program that doesn't load with the normal emulation (see above), you may
have better luck with the full 1541 processor emulation instead.

<P>With <B>“Map / ↔ \ in file names”</B> you control whether a '/' in
C64 filenames will be translated to '\' and vice versa for Directory Mode
drives. On many systems, the '/' character is used to access subdirectories,
but since the C64/1541 doesn't support subdirectories, that character is a
valid part of a C64 file name. This is a problem if a program wants to
create a file with a '/' in it, because the host system would interpret the
part before the '/' as a directory name and, finding no such directory,
would return an error and the operation would fail. If you activate this
checkbox all '/'s will transparently be translated into '\', so in directory
listings the '/' will still appear. If you turn off this option, you can
actually use the '/' to access files in subdirectories from the C64.


<H2>Video/Sound</H2>

<P>With <B>“Display Type”</B> you can choose whether the emulation shall run
in a window or in full-screen mode. You can also switch between modes while
Frodo is running by pressing the Enter key on the numeric keypad.

<P><B>“Initial Window Size”</B> allows you to select the factor by which the
emulation window is initially scaled up compared to the original C64 display
resolution. The window can also be resized later while Frodo is running.

<P>The <B>“Color Palette”</B> setting switches between two color schemes for
the C64 display: The <EM>“Pepto”</EM> palette produces vibrant colors, while
the <EM>“Colodore”</EM> palette is more desaturated but more closely
matches what the original video display on a C64 looked like.

<P>With <B>"Display Sprites"</B> you can switch the display of sprites on
and off. This setting should usually be on, unless you want to analyze the
sprite layer of a graphical effect on the C64.

<P><B>“Detect Sprite Collisions”</B> determines whether collisions between
sprites among themselves, and between sprites and background graphics should
be detected by the C64. Turning off collisions may make you invincible in
some older games (sadly, your enemies are likely to become invincible, too
<TT>:-/</TT>).

<P>Frodo normally uses the lower border of the C64 display to overlay some
information about the emulation speed (unless it is running at 100%) and a
representation of the activity/error LEDs of the emulated disk drives. By
deselecting <B>“Show Speed and Drive LED Status”</B> you can turn off this
display if you find that it distracts from the pure C64 experience.

<P>The <B>“Sound Emulation”</B> selection controls the type of sound output.
<EM>“None”</EM> means no sound, <EM>“Software”</EM> turns on the software
sound emulation. Under Linux, there is another option, <EM>“Catweasel”</EM>
for using a hardware SID chip on a Catweasel MK3 board (you also need
Catweasel kernel drivers for this).

<P>The <EM>“Software”</EM> setting also gives you two choices for the kind
of C64 sound chip to emulate: The 6581 (recommended) is the original SID
chip, while the 8580 is a newer revision with some audible differences. At
the moment, the setting only affects the sound of combined waveforms in
Frodo. Some newer C64 software may only sound properly with the
<EM>“8580”</EM> setting, some software also gives you a choice which SID
chip to use. If in doubt, choose <EM>“6581”</EM>.

<P>The <B>“Enable SID Filters”</B> field enables the software emulation of
the SID sound filters. Actual SID chips have quite some variance in the
performance of their filters, and some C64 music may sound a little better
with the filter emulation disabled.


<H2>Input</H2>

<P><B>“Joystick Port 1/2”</B> allows you to select which connected game
controller you want to use for each of the two C64 joystick ports. Note that
most C64 games use a joystick in Port 2. If you don't want to use game
controllers, Frodo also offers a <A HREF="keyboard.html">joystick
emulation</A> on the numeric keypad.

<P>With <B>“Swap Joysticks”</B> you can swap the assignments of the two
joystick ports without having to re-select the attached game controllers.
If, for example, you only have one controller mapped to Port 2 but the
game expects a joystick in port 1, then you can simply activate “Swap
joysticks” and continue to use your already assigned controller.


<H2>Options</H2>

<P>When the field <B>“Limit speed”</B> is active, Frodo caps the speed
of the emulation at 100% of that of an original C64. This is usually what
you want when playing games.

<P>With the setting <B>“Fast Reset”</B> you can disable the memory test
which the C64 normally performs on a reset, and which takes about three
seconds. Under emulation, the memory test is not necessary and resetting the
C64 (F12 key) gets much faster when it is disabled.

<P><B>“REU size”</B> sets the size of the REU (RAM Expansion Unit) emulated
by Frodo or turns the REU emulation off (“None”). Very few programs actually
use the REU (operating systems like ACE and GEOS, and some utilities), so
you can usually leave this at the <EM>“None”</EM> setting.


<H2>Advanced</H2>

<P>The settings in this group are only available in Frodo Lite.

<P><B>“Cycles per line (CPU)”</B> and <B>“Cycles per Bad Line (CPU)”</B> set
the number of clock cycles available to the C64 CPU per normal raster line
and per Bad Line. If a program shows flickering lines or graphical flaws you
can try to slightly alter both values.

<P>With <B>“Cycles per line (CIA)”</B> you can control the speed of the CIA
timers. Entering a higher value increases the frequency of cursor blinking
and key repeat. Some programs don't run correcly with the default value.

<P><B>“Cycles per line (1541)”</B> sets the number of cycles available to
the 1541 processor emulation per raster line. There is normally no need to
change this value. This setting has no effect if 1541 processor emulation is
turned off.

<P>The settings for the four “cycles” coming closest to an original PAL C64
are (63, 23, 63, 64).

<P>The setting <B>“Clear CIA ICR on write”</B> is necessary to make some
programs (such as the games “Gyruss” and “Motos”) run that would otherwise
hang in an endless interrupt loop because they use an unusual technique to
acknowledge CIA interrupts (sometimes by accident, it appears...). It should
normally be turned off.

<H2>Menus and Other Buttons</H2>

<P>Clicking <B>“Start”/“Continue”</B> or selecting the respective command
from the “File” menu will close the settings window and start the actual
emulation or return to it. Likewise, <B>"Quit"</b> will discard your changes
to the settings and quit Frodo.

<P>With <B>“Create Disk Image File...”</B> in the “File” menu you can create
an empty .d64 image file if you need one, for example to save your progress
in a game. You can mount the created image file in the “Drive Paths”
settings.

<P>Once the emulation has been started you can use the <B>“Save
snapshot...”</B> command in the “File” menu to save the current state of the
emulated C64 to a file which you can then restore later using the <B>“Load
Snapshot...”</B> command.

<P>The <B>“SAM Monitor...”</B> command in the “Tools” menu starts the <A
HREF="sam.html">SAM</A> machine language monitor which allows you to inspect
the state of the running C64 program.
