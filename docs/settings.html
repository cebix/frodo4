<H1>Settings</H1>

<HR>

<P>After starting Frodo a settings window will appear, unless you have
started it by double-clicking on a disk, tape, or cartridge image file, or
by specifying an image file on the <A HREF="commandline.html">command line</A>.

<P>You can also bring up the settings window at any time by pressing
<B>F10</B> while the emulation is running.


<H2>Drives</H2>

<P>The box <B>&ldquo;Disk Drive Paths&rdquo;</B> has four fields, each corresponding to
one of four emulated Commodore 1541 floppy disk drives with the drive
numbers 8, 9, 10 and 11 (normally you only need drive 8). For each drive,
there is a <EM>file selection button</EM>, an <EM>&ldquo;Eject&rdquo; button</EM> and a
<EM>&ldquo;Next Disk&rdquo; button</EM>.

<P>Frodo offers three different modes for disk drive emulation (see <A
HREF="files.html">here</A> for details):

<UL>
<LI><EM>Disk Image Mode</EM> uses a binary dump of a 1541 floppy disk in the
.d64 or .x64 disk image format for providing true, sector-by-sector floppy
emulation. This is the preferred mode with the highest compatibility.
<LI><EM>Tape/Archive Mode</EM> makes the contents of a .t64 tape image file,
a LYNX archive file, or a single .p00 program file available to the emulated
C64 as a &ldquo;pseudo disk&rdquo;, which is accessed as if it was a floppy disk. For
actual tape drive emulation, see the <EM>&ldquo;Tape Drive Path&rdquo;</EM> settings,
below.
<LI><EM>Directory Mode</EM> makes the contents of a directory of the host
file system available to the emulated C64 as a &ldquo;pseudo disk&rdquo;.
</UL>

<P>The <B>file selection button</B> opens a dialog where you can choose a
.d64/.x64/.t64/LYNX file to mount in the corresponding drive on the emulator.
To select a directory for Directory Mode, choose any file within the
directory that is not of one of those image file types.

<P>Clicking on the <B>&ldquo;Eject&rdquo; button</B> unmounts the selected file or
directory from the respective drive. When full 1541 emulation is enabled,
the drive will behave like it has no disk in it, otherwise the drive will be
disconnected entirely.

<P>The <B>&ldquo;Next Disk&rdquo; button</B> only works in Disk Image Mode and changes
the mounted .d64/.x64/.g64 disk image file to the next one in a series.
Frodo tries to be a bit clever about figuring out what that &ldquo;next disk&rdquo;
actually is. If the image files have names ending with patterns like &ldquo;Disk
1&rdquo;/&ldquo;Disk 2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Side A&rdquo;/&ldquo;Side B&rdquo;, &ldquo;(1)&rdquo;/&ldquo;(2)&rdquo;, etc. it is usually successful.

<P>If <B>&ldquo;Enable Full 1541 Emulation&rdquo;</B> is turned on, the four emulated
1541s are disabled and replaced by a single 1541 emulation (drive 8) that
only operates on .d64/.x64/.g64 files, but emulates the entire 1541 hardware
and is compatible with most fast loaders and some forms of copy protection,
at the expense of considerably slower disk access. If you have a .d64 with a
program that doesn't load with the normal emulation (see above), you may
have better luck with the full 1541 processor emulation instead.

<P>With <B>&ldquo;Map / &harr; \ in file names&rdquo;</B> you control whether a '/' in
C64 filenames will be translated to '\' and vice versa for Directory Mode
drives. On many systems, the '/' character is used to access subdirectories,
but since the C64/1541 doesn't support subdirectories, that character is a
valid part of a C64 file name. This is a problem if a program wants to
create a file with a '/' in it, because the host system would interpret the
part before the '/' as a directory name and, finding no such directory,
would return an error and the operation would fail. If you activate this
checkbox all '/'s will transparently be translated into '\', so in directory
listings the '/' will still appear. If you turn off this option, you can
actually use the '/' to access files in subdirectories from the C64.

<P>In the box <B>&ldquo;Tape Drive Path&rdquo;</B> (not available in Frodo Lite) you can
choose a .tap tape image file to mount in the emulated &ldquo;Datasette&rdquo; tape
drive with drive number 1 The <EM>file selection button</EM> and <EM>&ldquo;Eject&rdquo;
button</EM> work in the same way as for the disk drives. Note that you
cannot use .t64 files for the tape drive even though they are often labeled
as &ldquo;tape images&rdquo;.

<P>When the emulation is running, the box also contains buttons which
correspond to the <B>&ldquo;Play&rdquo;</B>, <B>&ldquo;Record&rdquo;</B> and <B>&ldquo;Stop&rdquo;</B> buttons
of the tape drive, and additional <B>&ldquo;Rewind&rdquo;</B> and <B>&ldquo;Forward&rdquo;</B>
buttons which move the simulated tape to its start or end position,
respectively. When the C64 asks you to &ldquo;Press Record &amp; Play&rdquo; it is
sufficient to just click on the &ldquo;Record&rdquo; button. The &ldquo;Auto-Start Drive 1&rdquo;
function automatically rewinds the tape and presses the &ldquo;Play&rdquo; button for
you, so you will rarely have to touch these controls.

<P>There are some rare instances of software distributed on tape which
refuses to run if it sees a disk drive connected. In this case, turn off the
full 1541 emulation, and click &ldquo;Eject&rdquo; on all four disk drives.


<H2>Video/Sound</H2>

<P>With <B>&ldquo;Display Type&rdquo;</B> you can choose whether the emulation shall run
in a window or in full-screen mode. You can also switch between modes while
Frodo is running by pressing the Enter key on the numeric keypad.

<P><B>&ldquo;Initial Window Size&rdquo;</B> allows you to select the factor by which the
emulation window is initially scaled up compared to the original C64 display
resolution. The window can also be resized later while Frodo is running.

<P>The <B>&ldquo;Color Palette&rdquo;</B> setting switches between two color schemes for
the C64 display: The <EM>&ldquo;Pepto&rdquo;</EM> palette produces vibrant colors, while
the <EM>&ldquo;Colodore&rdquo;</EM> palette is more desaturated but more closely
matches what the original video display on a C64 looked like.

<P><B>&ldquo;Detect Sprite Collisions&rdquo;</B> determines whether collisions between
sprites among themselves, and between sprites and background graphics should
be detected by the C64. Turning off collisions may make you invincible in
some older games (sadly, your enemies are likely to become invincible, too
<TT>:-/</TT>).

<P>Frodo normally uses the lower border of the C64 display to overlay some
information about the emulation speed (unless it is running at 100%) and a
representation of the activity/error LEDs of the emulated disk drives. By
deselecting <B>&ldquo;Show Speed and Drive LED Status&rdquo;</B> you can turn off this
display if you find that it distracts from the pure C64 experience.

<P>The <B>&ldquo;Sound Emulation&rdquo;</B> selection controls the type of sound output.
<EM>&ldquo;None&rdquo;</EM> means no sound, <EM>&ldquo;Software&rdquo;</EM> turns on the software
sound emulation. Under Linux, there is another option, <EM>&ldquo;Catweasel&rdquo;</EM>
for using a hardware SID chip on a Catweasel MK3 board (you also need
Catweasel kernel drivers for this).

<P>The <EM>&ldquo;Software&rdquo;</EM> setting also gives you two choices for the kind
of C64 sound chip to emulate: The 6581 (recommended) is the original SID
chip, while the 8580 is a newer revision with some audible differences. In
Frodo, the setting affects the audio filters and the sound of combined
waveforms. Some newer C64 software (1990s onwards) may only sound properly
with the <EM>&ldquo;8580&rdquo;</EM> setting, some software also gives you a choice
which SID chip to use. If in doubt, choose <EM>&ldquo;6581&rdquo;</EM>.


<H2>Input</H2>

<P><B>&ldquo;Joystick Port 1/2&rdquo;</B> allows you to select which connected game
controller you want to use for each of the two C64 joystick ports. Note that
most C64 games use a joystick in Port 2. If you don't want to use game
controllers, Frodo also offers a <A HREF="keyboard.html">joystick
emulation</A> on the numeric keypad.

<P>Because C64 joysticks typically only have one fire button many games use
the keyboard to control additional functions. With the &ldquo;Button Mapping&rdquo;
feature you can map game controller buttons to C64 keys so you can play a
game using only the controller, without having to reach for the keyboard.
The <B>&ldquo;Edit...&rdquo;</B> button lets you define named button mappings which you
can then select with the <B>&ldquo;Button Mapping&rdquo; chooser</B>. For example, the
game &ldquo;Turrican&rdquo; normally uses the F7 key for throwing grenades and the SPACE
bar to activate the energy lines and the gyroscope. You can create a new
button mapping named &ldquo;Turrican&rdquo; to assign these two keys to buttons on your
controller which you find convenient.

<P>The selected button mapping always applies to both controller ports. Note
that the &ldquo;A&rdquo; (or Cross) button is always mapped to the joystick fire button,
and the left and right trigger buttons control the rewind and
fast-forwarding features of Frodo. These mappings cannot be changed. The
&ldquo;PLAY&rdquo; key which you can map refers to the Play button on the &ldquo;Datasette&rdquo;
tape drive. This mapping is intended for the game &ldquo;Aquarius&rdquo; which uses the
Datasette as its controller.

<P>With <B>&ldquo;Swap Joysticks&rdquo;</B> you can swap the assignments of the two
joystick ports without having to re-select the attached game controllers.
If, for example, you only have one controller mapped to Port 2 but the
game expects a joystick in port 1, then you can simply activate &ldquo;Swap
joysticks&rdquo; and continue to use your already assigned controller.

<P>If the <B>&ldquo;Twin-Stick Mode&rdquo;</B> option is enabled, the right stick on
each game controller controls the direction of the joystick on the opposite
port. This is used to play games like &ldquo;Robotron 2084&rdquo;, which normally use
one joystick for movement and a second for firing, with only a single game
controller. Use the &ldquo;Swap Joysticks&rdquo; option if the stick assignment is
wrong. Not recommended for two-player games.

<P>The <B>&ldquo;Enable Tape Motor Rumble&rdquo;</B> option allows the C64 to control
rumble effects on the attached game controllers via the tape drive motor
signal. The game &ldquo;Aquarius&rdquo; uses this for providing haptic feedback. You
should normally leave this option off.


<H2>Options</H2>

<P>When the field <B>&ldquo;Limit Speed to 100%&rdquo;</B> is active, Frodo caps the
speed of the emulation at 100% of that of an original C64. This is usually
what you want when playing games.

<P>With the setting <B>&ldquo;Fast Reset&rdquo;</B> you can bypass the memory test which
the C64 normally performs on a reset, and which takes about three seconds to
complete. Under emulation, this test is not necessary and resetting the C64
(F12 key) gets much faster when it is bypassed.

<P>The &ldquo;Expansion Slot&rdquo; group allows you to attach various devices to the
expansion slot of the emulated C64. Under <B>&ldquo;Memory Expansion&rdquo;</B> you can
set the type and size of a RAM expansion module emulated by Frodo, or turn
the emulation off (<EM>&ldquo;None&rdquo;</EM>). Very few C64 software actually uses a
RAM expansion (operating systems like ACE and GEOS, some disk copy
utilities, and the port of the &ldquo;Sonic the Hedgehog&rdquo; game, for example), so
you can usually leave this at the <EM>&ldquo;None&rdquo;</EM> setting.

<P>If the &ldquo;Memory Expansion&rdquo; is set to <EM>&ldquo;None&rdquo;</EM>, you can use the
<B>&ldquo;Cartridge&rdquo; file selection button</B> to choose a .crt cartridge image
file to attach to the C64. At the moment, Frodo only supports regular ROM
cartridges (that means no Ultimax, no Action Replay, no EasyFlash, nor any
other funny things). When attaching a new cartridge, Frodo will reset the
C64 to allow the cartridge software to start properly. Click on the
<B>&ldquo;Eject&rdquo; button</B> to remove the cartridge from the emulated C64 and
return it to normal operation, ready to load disk-based games again.

<P>Frodo comes with built-in standard C64 and 1541 drive firmware. If you
want to use alternative firmware you can supply your own ROM files and use
the functions of the &ldquo;Firmware ROMs&rdquo; group to define sets of firmware ROMs
using the <B>&ldquo;Edit...&rdquo;</B> button, and then switch between them with the
<B>&ldquo;Firmware Set&rdquo; chooser</B>. If, for example, you have JiffyDOS ROMs you
can create a new firmware set called &ldquo;JiffyDOS&rdquo; and choose your JiffyDOS
Kernal and Drive ROM files for this set, leaving the Basic and Char ROMs at
the built-in defaults. When switching between firmware sets, Frodo will
reset the C64 to allow the new firmware to start properly.


<H2>Advanced</H2>

<P>The settings in this group are only available in Frodo Lite.

<P><B>&ldquo;Cycles per line (CPU)&rdquo;</B> and <B>&ldquo;Cycles per Bad Line (CPU)&rdquo;</B> set
the number of clock cycles available to the C64 CPU per normal raster line
and per Bad Line. If a program shows flickering lines or graphical flaws you
can try to slightly alter both values.

<P>With <B>&ldquo;Cycles per line (CIA)&rdquo;</B> you can control the speed of the CIA
timers. Entering a higher value increases the frequency of cursor blinking
and key repeat. Some programs don't run correcly with the default value.

<P><B>&ldquo;Cycles per line (1541)&rdquo;</B> sets the number of cycles available to
the 1541 processor emulation per raster line. There is normally no need to
change this value. This setting has no effect if 1541 processor emulation is
turned off.

<P>The settings for the four &ldquo;cycles&rdquo; coming closest to an original PAL C64
are (63, 23, 63, 64).

<P>The setting <B>&ldquo;Clear CIA ICR on write&rdquo;</B> is necessary to make some
programs (such as the games &ldquo;Gyruss&rdquo; and &ldquo;Motos&rdquo;) run that would otherwise
hang in an endless interrupt loop because they use an unusual technique to
acknowledge CIA interrupts (sometimes by accident, it appears...). It should
normally be turned off.


<H2>Menus and Other Buttons</H2>

<P>Clicking <B>&ldquo;Start&rdquo;/&ldquo;Continue&rdquo;</B> or selecting the respective command
from the &ldquo;File&rdquo; menu will close the settings window and start the actual
emulation or return to it. Likewise, <B>"Quit"</b> will discard your changes
to the settings and quit Frodo.

<P><B>&ldquo;Auto-Start Drive 8 / 1&rdquo;</B> starts the emulation and auto-runs the
software from the image file mounted in disk drive 8 or tape drive 1 using
standard load commands (to start from tape you have to eject the disk in
drive 8). It behaves the same way as pressing Ctrl-F12 while the emulator is
running.

<P>With <B>&ldquo;Create Disk Image File...&rdquo;</B> in the &ldquo;File&rdquo; menu you can create
an empty .d64 image file if you need one, for example to save your progress
in a game. Likewise, the <B>&ldquo;Create Tape Image File...&rdquo;</B> command creates
a blank .tap image file for the tape drive. You can mount the created image
files in the &ldquo;Disk Drive Paths&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tape Drive Path&rdquo; settings,
respectively.

<P>Once the emulation has been started you can use the <B>&ldquo;Save
snapshot...&rdquo;</B> command in the &ldquo;File&rdquo; menu to save the current state of the
emulated C64 to a file which you can then restore later using the <B>&ldquo;Load
Snapshot...&rdquo;</B> command.

<P><EM>Warning: The format of snapshot files is expected to change in future
versions of Frodo, so don't get too attached to your saved snapshots.</EM>

<P>The <B>&ldquo;SAM Monitor...&rdquo;</B> command in the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; menu starts the <A
HREF="sam.html">SAM</A> machine language monitor which allows you to inspect
the state of the running C64 program.
